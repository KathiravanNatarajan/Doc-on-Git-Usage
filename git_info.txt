Git Reflections : 
--------------------


git log :   you ll get all commits of the file/repo/project 

git diff first_input second_input 


when u faced some bug,  and if you know the particular stable version 


git checkout <commit id>




If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

  
  
git workspace setup : 

	git-completion.bash.
	git-prompt.sh.
	.bash_profile

	
	
	
	Making git configurations 
	------------------------------
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3


in .bash_profile:

alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe"


hidden files can be found by --      			ls -a 				in git bash 

|					|				|					|
|					|				|					|
|	working dir   	|  stage area 	|	  Repository   	|
|					|				|					|
|					|				|					|
|					|				|					|

git init	-- initialise the git working repository with .git (hidden file )
git add		-- adds files to the stage area  from working directory
git status   -- 

git commit   --   commits the files from staging area to the repository



git diff 			-				 difference between working directory and stage area 

git diff --staged    -				difference between stage area and repository


git reset --hard    -  				resetthe changes which are not commited or added to the staging area


git branch 			- 				display the branches are there in the working dir

git branch <branch_name>	- 		creates the new branch



git checkout easy-mode   	- 		   switch to another branch
sunka@DESKTOP-4JR6FSK MINGW64 ~/Desktop/New Work (master)
$ git checkout easy-mode
Switched to branch 'easy-mode'




git log --graph --oneline master easy-mode  		-  	helps with commit history when multiple users are working with the same file



git checkout -b <branch-name>
						is equal to 
						
git branch <new-branch-name>
git checkout <new-branch-name>

git show <Commit_id>  			-- 			shows the changed performed in the commit


 git log -n 1					- 			shows the last commit <last one commit>
 
 
 
 git remote 				- 				checks what are the remotes which are connected 
 
 git remote add origin https://github.com/KathiravanNatarajan/Titanic-Survival-exploration.git   -- 
					origin is something like the name of the remote 
					and <address of the git should be given as a parameter>
					
					
					
git remote -v 					- 			-v means verbose [Which has more information on the remote]


git push origin master			-			origin(name of remote), master(master branch)
											pushes the remote data into the github.com
